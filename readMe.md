## E2E Cypress e2e tests for Option 1

#### Tests are written for webapp Tour Of Heroes

I prepared simple e2e tests which should cover all branches of webapp. I focused on main navigation paths based on documentaion on Angular webpage and my actual interaction with app. I also focused also on testing main functionality, where I covered positive and also negative test cases.
